''' Very silly script to sync all of my github repose with their remotes at work... 
Assumes upstreams have already been set up properly. Good excuse to practice async python
 e.g. make sure subprocess process finishes before moving to the next one. 
 Also good excuse to run as celery job. '''

# indicate what directory holds git repos

# for each subdirectory in that directory...

# double check it is actually a git repo... if not move to next file

#1. git fetch upstream

#2. git checkout master

#3. git merge upstream/master
